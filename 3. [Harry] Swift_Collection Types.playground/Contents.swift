/* ⭐️The Basics
 
 1️⃣ Swift is a new programming language for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS app development.
 2️⃣ Swift provides its own versions of all fundamental C and Objective-C types.
    (Int, Double, Float, Bool, String, Array, Set, Dictionary)
 3️⃣ Swift uses variables to store and refer to values by an identifying name.
 4️⃣ Swift also makes extensive use of variables whose values can’t be changed. These are known as constants
 5️⃣ Swift introduces advanced types not found in Objective-C, such as tuples.
 6️⃣ Swift also introduces optional types, which handle the absence of a value.
 7️⃣ Optionals say either “there is a value, and it equals x” or “there isn’t a value at all”.
 8️⃣ Swift is a type-safe language, which means the language helps you to be clear about the types of values your code can work with.

/* ⭐️The Basics - Constants and Variables
 1️⃣ The value of a constant can't be changed once it's set, whereas a variable can be set to a different value in the future.

let harryEyes = 2      //Declare a new constant called harryEyes, and give it a value of 2.
var harryHeight = 178  //Declare a new variable called harryheight, and give it an initial value of 0
