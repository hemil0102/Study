/* ‚≠êÔ∏èThe Basics */
/*     1Ô∏è‚É£ Swift is a new programming language for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS app development.
       2Ô∏è‚É£ Swift provides its own versions of all fundamental C and Objective-C types.
          (Int, Double, Float, Bool, String, Array, Set, and Dictionary)
       3Ô∏è‚É£ Swift uses variables to store and refer to values by an identifying name.
       4Ô∏è‚É£ Swift also makes extensive use of variables whose values can‚Äôt be changed. These are known as constants
       5Ô∏è‚É£ Swift introduces advanced types not found in Objective-C, such as tuples.
       6Ô∏è‚É£ Swift also introduces optional types, which handle the absence of a value.
       7Ô∏è‚É£ Optionals say either ‚Äúthere is a value, and it equals x‚Äù or ‚Äúthere isn‚Äôt a value at all‚Äù.
       8Ô∏è‚É£ Swift is a type-safe language, which means the language helps you to be clear about the types of values your code can work with. */




/* ‚≠êÔ∏èThe Basics - Constants and Variables */
/*     1Ô∏è‚É£ The value of a constant can't be changed once it's set, whereas a variable can be set to a different value in the future.
       ‚ö†Ô∏è If a stored value in your code won't change, always decalre it as a constant with the let keyword.
        Use variables only for storing values that need to be able to change. */

/* ‚≠êÔ∏èThe Basics - Type Safety and Type Inference */
/*     1Ô∏è‚É£ A type safe language encourages you to be clear about the types of values your code can work with.
          If part of your code requires a String, you can't pass it an Int by mistake.
       2Ô∏è‚É£ Type safety performs 'type check' when compiling your code and flags any mismatched types as errors.
          This enables you to catch and fix errors as ealry as possible in the development process.
       3Ô∏è‚É£ Type-checking helps you avoid errors when you're working with different types of values.
          Type Inference enables a compiler to deduce the type of a particular expression automatically
          when it compiles your code, simply by examing the values you provide.
       4Ô∏è‚É£ Type inference is particularly useful when you declare a contant or variable with an intial value.
          This is often done by assigning 'a literal value (or literal)' to the constant or variable at the point that you declare it.
          (A literal value is a value that appears directly in your source code, such as 42 and 3.14159 in the examples below. */

let exercisingTime = 2
// exercisingtime is inferred to be of type Int
let pi = 3.14159
print(type(of: pi))
// if you don't specify a type for a floating-point literal, Swift infers that you want to create a Double.
let anotherPi = 3 + 0.14159
print(type(of: anotherPi))
// interger + double will be double type.
